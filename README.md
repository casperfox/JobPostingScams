## Introduction

## The First Encounter
While looking for jobs on LinkedIn, I found a remote IT Analyst position at Nebulon Dynamics Limited. It matched all the specific things I was looking for in a career. So, I applied on their website, redirected by LinkedIn, and hoped to hear back. On November 26th at 9:59 am, I received an email back and found the first email suspicious. To remove spam responses, they asked me to send an email to their official recruitment address. To test it out, I sent an email to the address to confirm that I am still interested in the position.
