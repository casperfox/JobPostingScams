# Job Posting Scams

## Introduction
As we head into 2025, job hunting will only become more challenging. With a rise in fake job postings and more companies using AI to evaluate resumes, it can be discouraging. But we, the ones looking for jobs, need to become more vigilant and careful so we don't waste our time applying for non-existing jobs. This highlights my experience with suspicious job listings and emails claiming to offer me an amazing salary without even meeting me! I will go over the time frame of this occurring and the steps I followed to determine whether this offer was real or not.

## My Experience
While looking for jobs on LinkedIn, I found a remote IT Analyst position at Nebulon Dynamics Limited. It matched all the specific things I was looking for in a career. So, I applied on their website, redirected by LinkedIn, and hoped to hear back. On November 26th at 9:59 am EST, I received an email back and found the first email suspicious. To remove spam responses, they asked me to send an email to their official recruitment address. To test it out, I emailed the address to confirm that I am still interested in the position.

On November 28th at 7:01 am EST, I received an email sharing details about the job responsibilities and they wanted me to answer a few questions about myself. I sent back my responses to these questions. I still found this position slightly suspicious, but I figured it was just a way of narrowing down the applicants.

On December 2nd at 9:51 pm EST, I received an email, but not a response to my previous sent email. They sent a completely separate email, not within the same email conversation we were having. In this email, they asked for professional references, in which I provided them with my references.

On December 13th at 11:20 am EST, they again sent a separate email saying that they wanted to offer me the position.

At first, I was excited to get my first offer, but then I noticed a few things.

1. $40 an hour seemed like a lot to me, with my lack of experience and only my bachelor's degree. The offer seemed too good to be true.
2. I didn't even have an interview or online meeting with them.

Because of this, I decided to investigate and dive deeper into this company and its history.

## Investigation
The first thing I wanted to look at was the company's LinkedIn page, to see if I could reach out to an employee with the company or find the HR employee that reached out to me in one of the emails.

When looking at their LinkedIn page, I clicked on the "People" tab and it showed 0 associated members.

This was strange to me. You would think that it would show a list of employees, but no one is listed. I then decided to look for the HR employee by searching on LinkedIn and could only find these results.

- Miguel Esteban - Senior Analyst at Gain Theory
- Miguel Esteban - Principal Investigator
- Jose Miguel Esteban - MEing in Biomedical Engineering Candidate

The next thing I decided to do was to just do a simple Google search. What would come up when I searched for Nebulon Dynamics Limited? One interesting thing I found in the Google search was a YouTube page for the company. It had a few subscribers and its videos advertising the company have a little over 300 views and was posted two months ago.

I also found a Reddit post of someone asking about a job with Nebulon Dynamics Limited and had many of the same concerns that I had.

After reviewing many Google search results for the company, I decided to analyze the emails that were sent to me and look into the details available on their website. I reviewed the email header in Yahoo Mail by clicking on the three dots below the email and selecting view raw message. I want to validate that this email is a legitimate email from the company.

It appears to have been sent from the legitimate website domain for their website, but I looked into this a little further using an IP lookup service. It appears that one of the IP addresses leads to Hostinger and NameCheap, which is a website provider for running websites. It also appears that they are using Jellyfish Systems.

To also confirm the information of the website, I went to Who.is to find out more.

![WhoIs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7deeb72-b7d0-4690-8c7b-504c30845ae4)

I found out that the website was just registered on October 23rd, 2024, only a few months ago. I also noticed that the website was registered after their YouTube channel uploaded videos about the company, which was in September of 2024. The whole thing is very suspicious.

## Insight & Recommendations
Based on everything I have analyzed about this job and company, I believe that this job is fake and not legit. The key indicators were the fact that they never did a face-to-face or online interview and how recently the company's website was made. Something is not right with this company and job posting. I feel that LinkedIn and other job posting websites should really focus on filtering out job posts, confirming that the companies on their platform and the job posts being made on their platforms are legit.

To prevent this from happening again, I encourage everyone who is applying for jobs using websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to:

- Look deeper into the companies you are applying for
- Do not provide any personal information via email unless you can verify it is them
- Do not accept any job offers if you haven't met with someone in person or online
- Don't be discouraged after dealing with something like this. Keep on working, applying, and working hard

## Conclusion
This summarizes my experience with applying for jobs and highlights the importance of paying attention to the companies you apply for and job postings you are interested in. Using OSINT techniques, I was able to determine whether a job offer and company were legit or not. If it's too good to be true, then it truly is. Stay smart and vigilant!
